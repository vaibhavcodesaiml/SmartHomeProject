👋 About Me

Hi! I’m Vaibhav Bhardwaj, a B.Tech student passionate about Java programming and smart home technologies.

This project is my enhanced fork of the original Smart Home system by pragyanshdixit. I have:

Added clear documentation and comments for better readability.

Improved variable names and code structure for maintainability.

Introduced a new feature to list all active appliances.

Organized the user menu for a smoother experience.

My goal with this fork is to learn, experiment, and contribute back to the open-source community while showcasing my coding skills.

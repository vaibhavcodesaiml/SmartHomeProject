## About Me

Hi, I’m Vaibhav Bhardwaj. I’m currently pursuing my B.Tech, and I’m really into Java programming and all things related to smart homes.

This project started as a fork of pragyanshdixit’s Smart Home system. I wanted to take the original idea and make improvements that would help anyone learning Java or interested in smart home concepts. Here’s what I’ve done so far:

- Added clear documentation and comments so it’s easier to follow the code.
- Improved variable names and cleaned up the structure for better readability and maintenance.
- Added a feature to show all active appliances.
- Made the menu more organized so users have a smoother experience.

My aim is to keep learning, experiment with new ideas, and hopefully give back to the open-source community.

## Project Overview

SmartHomeSystem_Vaibhav is a simple Java console application that lets you simulate a smart home setup. You can control and manage devices like lights, fans, and temperature sensors directly from your terminal.

The project is built with object-oriented programming principles and clean code practices. This version is especially focused on being easy for beginners to understand, with helpful comments and a feature for quickly checking which devices are turned on.

## Features

- Add new appliances to your smart home system.
- Turn devices on or off through a straightforward interface.
- View all appliances and their current status.
- Instantly see which devices are currently active.
- Easy-to-use menu for smooth navigation.

## Main Components

- **Appliance Class:** Represents each device, with properties like name and status.
- **SmartHome Class:** Handles all the appliances and lets you add, control, or list them.
- **SmartHomeMain Class:** Acts as the entry point, managing user input and menu navigation.

## Plans for the Future

I’m thinking about adding some cool new features, like:

- A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use.
- Database support so appliance data can be saved and loaded.
- A mobile app version so you can control your smart home from your phone.

## Technologies

- Java (JDK 8+)
- ArrayList and OOP concepts for managing devices

---

## How to Use

Just follow the prompts in the menu to add appliances, switch them on or off, or check which ones are active. When you’re done, you can exit using the Exit option.
